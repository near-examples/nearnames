TODO: Document which contracts are involved and what the flow is.

# Analytics

We have built a Zapier endpoint that tracks analytics of the accounts created via this tool.

See `ANALYTICS_URL` in [src/state/near.js](src/state/near.js).

TODO: Document where the analytics reports can be viewed and where the Zapier endpoint is configured and how.
